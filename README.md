"In this project, we developed a Student Performance Predictor for EduQuest Coaching with the goal of identifying students who may require academic support. By analyzing various factors such as past exam scores, attendance rates, homework completion, class participation, and demographic information, we built a machine learning model to classify students into "High Risk" and "Low Risk" categories.

We performed thorough data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature encoding. Visual tools like boxplots, countplots, and a correlation heatmap provided insights into which factors most influence student performance.

Using a Random Forest Classifier, the system accurately predicted at-risk students based on key academic and behavioral features. The model showed strong correlation between performance and variables like previous exam scores, learning hours, and class participation.

This predictor empowers EduQuest Coaching to:

    **Identify struggling students early,

    **Tailor educational interventions,

    **Improve retention and academic outcomes.

With further development, this system can be integrated into a user-friendly dashboard or web platform for real-time monitoring and decision-making"
